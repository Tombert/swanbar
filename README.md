# Swanbar

A custom Sway title bar written in Clojure and compiled with GraalVM. 

# Why? 

I don't know.  I had a custom title bar written with Bash that did all this stuff, but it got messy.  The protocol for the Sway is pretty easy, and so I thought it might be fun to overengineer the hell out of it. 

And overengineer I did!  I used `core.async` liberally to minimize blocking, and I have plans...plans I tell you!
